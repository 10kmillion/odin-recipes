    <h2>Lightly breaded and fried, Crispy Tofu makes for an excellent snack or main entree.</h2>
    <p>Tofu: some people love it, some people hate it. I, however, believe that the people who hate it just haven't had it prepared in the right way.</p>
    
    <p>But no worries, friends - what if I told you that you could have the best, easiest, and crispiest Tofu EVER…with only 3 ingredients total and super simple steps?! Well, I'm tellin' ya. This crisp-on-the-outside, soft-on-the-inside Tofu is about to change. your. life. And become a regular staple in your recipe rotation. </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>(1) 14 ounce block Extra Firm Tofu</li>
        <li>1 TBSP reduced-sodium Tamari</li>
        <li>2 TBSP nutritional yeast, plus more to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>First, preheat the oven to 425F. Drain the liquid from the Tofu and “press” the extra liquid out by wrapping it in a clean dish towel, or by using a Tofu press. Try to get it as dry as possible!</li>
        <li>Cut the Tofu into even cubes. I like to cut the block in half lengthwise, then cut each rectangle into 16 even cubes.  (Note: I like to lightly press the cubes with the dish towel if I have extra time/patience)</li>
        <li>Add the cubed Tofu to a large bowl, then use a spatula to gently toss it with the Tamari, until evenly coated. Add the Nutritional Yeast, then gently mix until coated. Add more Nutritional Yeast or extra seasonings to taste, if desired.</li>
        <li>Transfer the cubes to a baking sheet lined with a silicone mat, leaving space between the cubes. Bake on the top rack of the oven for 20 minutes, then carefully flip the cubes. Bake for another 20-30 minutes, depending on how crispy you like your tofu. The Tofu will also get slightly crispier as it cools.</li>
        <li>Serve as desired; leftovers will last in the fridge for up to one week.</li>
    </ol>
